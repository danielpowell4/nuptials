          Thankfully one no longer needs to trek from Del Norte over Stony
          Pass--headwaters of the Rio Grande--to arrive. The town is accessible
          by the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad. Though this classic
          steam engine is perhaps the most scenic way to arrive, it is also the
          slowest.

          Durango is known to Silvertonians as the {`'Big City'`}. It is the
          closest airport and is about 50 miles from Silverton. The drive from
          the airport is about an hour and a half over two chill mountain
          passes--Coal Bank and Molas.
