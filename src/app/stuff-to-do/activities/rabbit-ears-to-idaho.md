From the top of the <a href="/stuff-to-do/kendall-lift-line">Kendall Ski Lift Line</a>, continue up to the looker's right. A sign for a ski run aiming uphill will point you in the right direction. When in doubt of where the trail, guess "up" and to the left.

As you near Rabbit Ear's, an avalanche path and clear gap in the trees, continue if you want to get to the Idaho mine and see a stellar view of town.

You can also drop down to the road from a few spots.

Here are a few Strava routes from a few years' back with Beacon's pals Wemi and Orsin. In both I went a bit past the Idaho portal, where bits of the trail got a wee bit adventurous.
