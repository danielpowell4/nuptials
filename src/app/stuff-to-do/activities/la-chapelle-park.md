Named for legendary mountaineer, ecologist and fellow DU grad, <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_LaChapelle">Dolores LaChapelle</Link>, this gem of a park is right outside of town.

Park near the water tanks just past Hillside Cemetary, and catch a maintained third-of-a-mile trail through some aspen trees.

For the adventurous, a tree on the far side has some sweet nets that are fun to climb into and relax in for a bit.
