Located at the end of Greene St, Memorial Park offers an open well-kept lawn that's great for throwing a frisbee, kicking a soccer ball and catching a concert during Silverton's summer sounds series. It also features grass tennis courts and low-stakes slack lining.

Great spot for a picnic and taking in a view.
