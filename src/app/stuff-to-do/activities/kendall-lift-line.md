Catch the lift line from the base of Kendall. From the Wyman, cross Greene st and walk across the bridges to Cement Creek and then the upper Animas River.

From there you can head straight up the ski lift line to the top, where rasberries have been known to bloom. From here alternate routes exist on your way down (or farther up.)

Per Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Mountain_Ski_Area">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Mountain_Ski_Area</a>

Kendall Mountain is a small ski area located at the town of Silverton, Colorado. It was developed by the Grand Imperial Hotel in the 1950s and opened for business in the early 1960s. In 1983, the area was found to be operating without a permit and remained closed until the late 1990s. It advertises itself as "the cheapest ski area in the West." The area has run with a single 950-foot (290 m) tow rope for most of its operation but upgraded to a double chairlift in 2006,[1] purchased from the Quechee Ski Area in Vermont. Kendall Mountain's base elevation is 9,300 feet (2,800 m) and has 35 acres (140,000 m2) of skiable terrain in 11 runs.
