This trail heads up over cement creek from town. It's a special one for us as it was somewhere we got to share with Dan's dad Richard on a visit.

Lots of up's and down's head over three creeks (no need to get wet) as you arrive at Niagara gulch under Anvil Mountain's true summit.

As the name suggests, it's often damp on this sun-protected side. To enter you need to cross the private property sign near the first major turn of the shrine road from 15th street.
