Great spot to canoe, paddle board or take in a sunrise!

"If you should, in your imagination, put together in one small group, perhaps 12 miles square, all the heights and depths, the rugged precipices and polished faces of rock, and all the sharp pinnacles and deeply indented crests, and twenty times the inaccessible summits that both of us have ever seen, you would not have a picture equal to this."

- W.H. Holmes, describing the San Juan Mountains in 1876.
