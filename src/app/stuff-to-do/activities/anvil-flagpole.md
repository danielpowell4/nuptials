This local staple goes straight up the 'S-hill'. Over the years we've seen both a Trump and a rainbow flag hoisted.

You catch a light trail from 12th street and head up, up, up this initial Strava segment (<a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/9684094">https://www.strava.com/segments/9684094</a>). After you top out the first hill, you head down then up a shoulder towards the cliffs that can be seen above the Shrine to find a flagpole jammed into the rocks.
