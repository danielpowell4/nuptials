Since we moved to Mineral St, Fairy Trail has become our daily driver.

Some in town call this 'Lackawanna' trail but we find that name to fall a bit short both because the mine is very close to what I see as the start of the 'real' trail and because the mine was never too.

Depending on the year, this is either the start or end of the Hardrock 100 course. From the Kendall recreation center parking lot near the ice rink where a sign and old Hardrock stone lie, head up the hill near the ice rink and into the woods--lookers left of the ski lift. A bridge that's worth of a nice sit takes you across a creek and points you in the right direction. After arriving at the Lackawanna mine, continue across the rugged "road", bending right at a fork. From there you head up for a while before dropping down.

We find a natural turnaround to be the beaver ponds--about 1.5 miles from the parking lot--but you can continue until the gate on County Road 20A in Arrastra Gulch.
