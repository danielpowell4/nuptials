The first trail we found after moving to town, Rainbow was previously known as Dan's favorite trail. Few times go by heading north to Ouray when Dan doesn't mention to Julia something about the trail or how much faster cars go over traveling by foot.

The full trail to the Ophir Pass / Burro Bridge turn off is about 9 miles in-and-out but many good turn arounds exist for shorter travel.

The route ran as a railroad from 1888 to 1926 and is a key piece of the Otto Mears legacy, which includes Monarch + Lizard Head passes.
