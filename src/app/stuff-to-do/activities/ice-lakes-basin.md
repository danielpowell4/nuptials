Known to some as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=598461964&q=ice+lakes+silverton+site:instagram.com&tbm=isch">instagram lake</a>, this San Juan gem attracts the biggest crowds but features a trio of BLUE alpine lakes.

We recommend heading up to Island Lake first and then going to Ice Lakes as outlined by All Trails. Fuller Lake features a fixer upper but otherwise a wee bit of the ugly step child when compared to its neighbors.
