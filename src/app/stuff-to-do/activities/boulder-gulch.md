Accessible from town via a closed-to-cars access road that you can catch near the water tanks above the Hillside cemetary, Boulder Gulch is known as 'where the water comes from'.

Crazy mountain bikers hike-a-bike up from the Velocity Basin side and drop down: https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7040661/boulder-gulch-trail. You can also approach from the mythical South Fork of the Animas.
